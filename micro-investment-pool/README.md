# üèòÔ∏è Micro-Investment Pool for Real Estate

A decentralized investment platform built on Stacks blockchain that enables users to pool STX tokens for real estate projects with secure, admin-controlled fund distribution.

## üéØ Overview

This Clarity smart contract system creates a trustless investment pool where:
- **Investors** contribute STX tokens to a shared pool
- **Administrators** manage approved real estate projects
- **Funds** are securely released only to verified, active projects
- **Transparency** is maintained through on-chain tracking of all contributions and distributions

---

## üì¶ Contract Architecture

### `pool.clar`
The core investment management contract that:
- **Accepts STX contributions** from investors via `add-investment`
- **Tracks individual balances** for each contributor
- **Manages total pool funds** with automatic balance updates
- **Enables controlled fund release** to approved projects only
- **Implements security checks** for all fund transfers

### `projects.clar`
The project registry contract that:
- **Maintains approved projects** with unique IDs and metadata
- **Stores project status** (active/inactive) for validation
- **Provides admin controls** for adding and deactivating projects
- **Ensures data integrity** through structured project information

### `projects-trait.clar`
Interface definition that:
- **Defines contract interaction standards** for cross-contract calls
- **Ensures type safety** when querying project information
- **Enables secure inter-contract communication** between pool and projects

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet CLI](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- Basic understanding of Stacks blockchain and Clarity

### Installation & Testing
```bash
# Install Clarinet globally
npm install -g @hirosystems/clarinet

# Verify contract syntax
clarinet check

# Run test suite
clarinet test

# Start local development environment
clarinet integrate
```

## üîê Security Features

### Fund Protection
- **Actual STX transfers** - Funds are genuinely moved into the contract, not just tracked
- **Contract custody** - All pooled funds are held securely by the smart contract
- **Multi-layer validation** - Each transaction undergoes multiple security checks

### Access Control
- **Owner-only administration** - Only the contract owner can release funds
- **Project verification** - Funds can only be sent to pre-approved, active projects
- **Recipient validation** - Each fund release requires explicit recipient approval

### Cross-Contract Security
- **Trait-based validation** - Uses `projects-trait` to ensure safe contract interactions
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error codes for all failure scenarios
- **State consistency** - Atomic operations prevent partial state updates

## üìö API Reference

### Investment Functions (`pool.clar`)

#### `add-investment`
```clarity
(add-investment (amount uint)) ‚Üí (response bool uint)
```
**Purpose**: Allows users to contribute STX to the investment pool  
**Parameters**: 
- `amount` - STX amount to invest (in microSTX)
**Returns**: Success boolean or error code  
**Security**: Validates amount > 0, handles transfer failures

#### `release-to-project`
```clarity
(release-to-project (id uint) (amount uint) (recipient principal)) ‚Üí (response bool uint)
```
**Purpose**: Admin function to release funds to approved projects  
**Parameters**:
- `id` - Project ID from the registry
- `amount` - STX amount to release
- `recipient` - Wallet address to receive funds  
**Access**: Contract owner only  
**Security**: Verifies project exists and is active

### Query Functions

#### `get-total-pool`
```clarity
(get-total-pool) ‚Üí (response uint uint)
```
**Purpose**: Returns total STX currently in the pool  
**Access**: Public read-only

#### `get-contribution`
```clarity
(get-contribution (addr principal)) ‚Üí (response uint uint)
```
**Purpose**: Returns total contribution amount for a specific investor  
**Parameters**: `addr` - Investor's wallet address  
**Access**: Public read-only

### Project Management (`projects.clar`)

#### `add-project`
```clarity
(add-project (name (string-ascii 50))) ‚Üí (response uint uint)
```
**Purpose**: Registers a new real estate project  
**Parameters**: `name` - Project identifier (max 50 characters)  
**Returns**: Unique project ID  
**Access**: Admin only

#### `get-project`
```clarity
(get-project (id uint)) ‚Üí (response (tuple (name (string-ascii 50)) (active bool)) uint)
```
**Purpose**: Retrieves project information by ID  
**Returns**: Project name and active status

#### `deactivate-project`
```clarity
(deactivate-project (id uint)) ‚Üí (response bool uint)
```
**Purpose**: Marks a project as inactive (prevents fund releases)  
**Access**: Admin only
